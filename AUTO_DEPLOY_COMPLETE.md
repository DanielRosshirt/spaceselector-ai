# ✅ DONE! Database Will Auto-Populate on Railway

## What I Did For You:

1. ✅ **Ran the scraper locally** - Added 19 properties to database
2. ✅ **Created automatic startup script** - Railway will populate database on first run
3. ✅ **Updated Railway configuration** - Uses new startup script
4. ✅ **Pushed to GitHub** - Railway will auto-deploy

---

## 🎯 What Happens Next:

### Railway Auto-Deploy (2-3 minutes)

Railway will automatically:
1. Detect the new code from GitHub
2. Build and deploy your app
3. Run the startup script
4. The script will:
   - Check if database exists
   - If not, run `node scraper.js` automatically
   - Add all 19 properties with coordinates
   - Start the server

**You don't need to do anything!** Just wait for Railway to finish deploying.
